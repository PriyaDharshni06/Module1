# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Step 1: Input
Read an integer a from the user â†’ this will be the real part of a complex number.

Read another integer b from the user â†’ this will be the imaginary part of the complex number.

Step 2: Create Complex Number
Use the complex() function to create a complex number x = a + bj.

Step 3: Output
Print the complete complex number x.

Print the real part using x.real.

Print the imaginary part using x.imag.



## ðŸ’» Program
``` python

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```

## Output

## Result

Thus the python program to convert the real  number to complex number is executed successfully.
